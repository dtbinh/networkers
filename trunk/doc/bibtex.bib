 	abstract =	"Developing distributed applications for                 sensor/actuator 
networks is challenging, particularly,                 with regard to unreliable nodes and 
communication                 links. Splitting applications into roles eases the                 
development significantly but presumes a reliable role                 management that 
autonomously assigns roles to devices                 depending on their capabilities. In this 
paper, we                 present a self-organizing and self-stabilizing role                 
assignment mechanism as an integral part of a                 light-weight, flexible middleware. 
The deployed                 algorithms tolerate the addition and removal of devices                 
at runtime and are also able to recover from any                 transient fault. Considering 
that resources are                 restricted on many devices, we analyze the proposed                 
algorithms with respect to communication overhead,                 memory usage, and 
stabilization time.",

network is composed of a distributed collection of nodes, each of which has sensing, computation, communication and locomotion capabilities. 
Such networks are capable of self-deployment; i.e., starting from some compact initial configuration, the nodes in the network can spread out 
such that the area âcovered â by the network is maximized. In this paper, we present a potential-field-based approach to deployment. The fields 
are constructed such that each node is repelled by both obstacles and by other nodes, thereby forcing the network to spread itself throughout 
the environment. The approach is both distributed and scalable.},
